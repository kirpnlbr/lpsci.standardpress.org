## AcadArena’s CONQuest debuts in Manila this July

AcadArena’s CONQuest PH comes back this July 23-24, 2022 at the SMX Convention Center. The event boasts its largest convention line-up to date filled with international and local guests. With its slogan “the dopest Gaming x Pop Culture x Web3 expo in the Philippines, vibing since ‘17,” it highlights the assembly’s growth since its inception in 2017.

According to an interview with AcadArena’s Director of Events Peter Pham and the Philippine Star, the team decided that an event like this is better experienced live. Furthermore, Pham says there is something special about wandering through rows of artists’ works and meeting strangers with a mutual love for game.

CONQuest PH will have various booths and activities open to the attendees. Visitors can stroll through the Crafter’s Quarters to buy works from local artists or the Tech & Game Dev Expo to explore the latest games and gadgets on the show floor. Ticket-holders may also opt to have fun and play in the convention’s Retro and Freeplay Arcade.

Among the activities mentioned, participants may sit and listen to community panels and meet their favorite content creators, streamers, cosplayers, and pro gamers. Additionally, they may watch the Alliance Games Finals, the country’s biggest campus gaming league. 

The event boasts an abundance of well-known guests from various corners of the gaming & pop culture scene, both local and international. Well-recognized voice actors from the popular game Genshin Impact will make an appearance, such as Anne Yatco, Christian Banas and Ratana.

In addition, the event also got a hold of popular Genshin Impact streamer Tuonto, top osu! player BTMC, and OfflineTV’s LilyPichu & Michael Reeves to add on the roster.

Local popular Filipino streamers and content creators such as Razzie Binx, GLOCO, and JiConyo will also be attending the event.
