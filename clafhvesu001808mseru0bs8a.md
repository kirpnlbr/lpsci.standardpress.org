# Our Obsession with Talent by AMAFRAN

Talented would be<br>
how you describe someone like Mozart<br>
who wrote his first symphony at age 4,<br><br>

or someone like Bobby Fischer<br>
who was a chess grandmaster by 15 years old.<br>

It is said that geniuses get made once-a-century or so,<br>
yet good songs,<br>
⠀⠀good chess moves,<br>
⠀⠀⠀⠀good art,<br>
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀good ideas,<br>
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀good poems,<br>
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀good answers,<br>
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀and good discoveries<br>
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀are made by ordinary,<br>
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀non-Mozart-like people<br>

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀** every single day.**
