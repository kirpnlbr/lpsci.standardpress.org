# Midsummer Dreams and Midnight Seas
*Roku Zakoshujin*

"Please let me be, let me set myself free,<br>
Can't I break the shackles linking you to me?"<br>
Whispers seep down the endless sea:<br>
"Oh why, oh why, oh why?"<br>

Waking in a village by the blue,<br>
A sickening bloom stained the sky to grey,<br>
A suffocating gloom.<br>
I'd say, "There's no way to escape from that stale midsummer day,<br>
From you, the one I so hate.”<br>

I inked dreams of morning light;<br>
Tried erasing those nights of insomnia,<br>
Fueled with thoughts of you and paranoia.<br>

On the bayside strewn with stones,<br>
Watching waves wander alone;<br>
At the break of dawn,<br>
Though allured by the seascape,<br>
I dove right in and made my escape.<br>

Throwing myself in the tides of a salt-stricken sea,<br>
I burst into ripples where no eyes can see;<br>
Keeping still in a soaking stance,<br>
I smile in silent peace.<br>

I heard your name resound from the edge of the ground,<br>
As a sharp pain stirred my chest and my limbs flailed around;<br>
Float upright, but no one's in sight<br>
But I, but I, and I.<br>

Greeted by another dull sunrise, these ticking deadlines<br>
Push themselves away, contrary to design;<br>
So I dipped my toes once again,<br>
And my chest was drenched in dread.<br>
I said, "I wish you were dead."<br>

But these words, though sharp as knives,<br>
Can't stab through our measly lives.<br>
I let out a sigh,<br>
And the tides crashed in reply 'til the sun died.<br>

Now's another nameless night,<br>
Waves and glimmering moonlight;<br>
"What a lovely sight."<br>
But all things come to an end;<br>
"It's time to end this game of pretend."<br>

So I crashed down as a wake in the star-spotted sea,<br>
Delving deep into my ripping, rippling memories;<br>
Becoming one with the sky, I cry<br>
A lullaby-like plea.<br>

I knew there were some things that I swore I would slight,<br>
But a gloved hand grasped my foot - I needed no lifelines!<br>
Pull me to land, now I'm breathing fine,<br>
But why, but why, but why?<br>

Then the moon retired to the clouds,<br>
And a storm broke out.<br>
Should I say it to you out loud?<br>
"Please begone!"<br>

Let me sleep in this raging night.<br>
When dawn comes, I'll dive and feel alive.<br>
And I'll bathe in the heavenly light.<br>

Dawn came once more,<br>
And I faced the sun greeting the shore.<br>

Kind of.<br>

I feigned this "hate;”<br>
When I leave, at least this weight stays behind:<br>

This "love."<br>

Throwing myself to the tides<br>

Hear the crashes collide<br>

Over this ochre oblivion<br>

Rings my demise!<br>

Sinking still in a soaking stance,<br>
No, your hand won't stand a chance!<br>
Then I cried to the sky over my reddened eyes;<br>
Tears as salty as the sea complete the compromise!<br>
Sleeping soundly on the seafloor,<br>
'Tis I, ‘twas I, only I!<br>

I woke up on the other side,<br>
I saw everything else there was to life.<br>
