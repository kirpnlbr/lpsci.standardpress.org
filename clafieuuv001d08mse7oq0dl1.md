# Rusty
There is no any other loyal dog like Rusty,<br>
He may be clumsy, but he is indeed<br>
trustworthy,
He plays all day and behaves properly,<br>
He also follows master’s orders daily!<br>

He barks at the neighbors all day,<br>
“Woof woof,” he angrily say,<br>
The people ignored him, to his dismay,<br>
Poor Rusty, he just sat there and pray.<br>

His master gambles, and drink,<br>
But Rusty, surely can’t think,<br>
He tolerates his acts and idolize him forever,<br>
Of course, he is a dog, he will still follow his
patron master.<br>

The other dogs warned him, that his master
is an abuser,<br>
But Rusty did not listen, he just laughed
louder,<br>
He didn’t care, he don’t believe everyone,<br>
He only trusts his owner, and listens to no
one.<br>

Rusty’s master killed a cat once,<br>
Then, the dog witnessed it, with a brief
glance,<br>
He teared up as he believed that his master
was nice,<br>
He never knew that his master is a wolf but
uses a sheep as a disguise.<br>

Surprisingly, Rusty acted nothing happened,<br>
He wagged his tail when he saw his master
with his eyes,<br>
And no, he did not want to pretend,<br>
For he is still blinded by his master’s fruitful
lies.<br>

Oh to have a dog like Rusty!<br>
So loyal and surely trustworthy,<br>
He deserves all the bones and other treats,<br>
He must have chicken for dinner and a
whole bunch of meat.<br>

Oh, but don’t be like Rusty!<br>
Don’t tolerate someone who acts fishy,<br>
Don’t follow someone who is foolish and a
liar,<br>
Regain your dignity and ignite the fire!<br>
