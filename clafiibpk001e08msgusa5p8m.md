# The Promise You Hold by Lislah

# The Promise You Hold

To all those who have felt lost<br>
Unheard, dazed amidst an infinity;<br>
Bring forth a brazen bow<br>
Step forth, listen closely â€”for your time is now<br>

You are a candle waiting to be lit<br>
By the flame of the perfect moment<br>
Shine your myriad of colors<br>
Too long have you been waiting for it<br>

The ever so burning passion in your heart<br>
Let it not rest, but bloom with yearn<br>
A mystifying form of art;<br>
An unseen gem waiting for its turn<br>

Burn for your dreams daringly<br>
As echoes of truth shake the walls<br>
Even the clearest of waters;<br>
Envious of its purity<br>
