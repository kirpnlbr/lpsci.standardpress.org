# To My Best Friend by Rosa

“Goodbye.” I said brightly before hanging up.<br>
I wish I had the strength to speak, before we were forced to hold our peace.<br>
Time passed and clock still ticks. Your heart yearns for another, but mine is still learning to beat half as fast as it did.<br>
Maybe I'll be able to learn the way you made me feel.<br>
Maybe I'll be able to accept that I won't be able to treat you in the way I'd anticipated.<br>
Maybe I truly had no chance to be the first thing on your mind when you wake up,<br>
Or the last before you fall into a deep slumber.<br>
Maybe it was all a dream that I would be the one greeting you, “good morning, lovely”<br>
or, the one to kiss your troubles away, and the one to protect you like my life depended on it.<br>
Maybe I’ll be able to accept that your smile, bright as sunshine, isn’t for me or those cheeks that slightly reddens on the most subtle touches.<br>
Maybe I’ll be able to say the words “I pine for you... I love you.”<br>
But it was all a dream.<br>
I am not the one you long for.<br>
I am not the one you adore.<br>
I don’t deserve you and It’s impossible to win you, so I had to move on.<br>
It took me quite some time to realize that not everything in life has a happy ending. I blamed it all on the timing. But then I discovered that there is no such thing as bad timing.<br>
You were simply not made for me. You were meant to get away, and you were never meant to stay.<br>
You were out of my grasp,<br>
But my love still remains, and my heart still beats for you.<br>
I have to accept that I’m just your best friend<br>
Assisting you, and cheering you on.<br>
Time to time, I hoped those dreams were true.<br>
Foolish me still thinks about you.<br>

“Goodbye...” I said for the last time, finally letting go of ‘me and you’.<br>
