# My Unexpected Love 
*by Akira Moriyama*

"I am not in love with you." <br>
and that is a fact.<br>
A love that will never come through,<br>
a pair that will never attract.<br>

My heart beats fast whenever I see you,<br>
but how can I feel this for someone I'm not into?<br>
"Am I in love?". No, that can't be.<br>
"I'm not in love with you.", and that I guarantee.<br>

For so long I've denied these feelings deep inside me.<br>
I don't want to get hurt if I know we aren't meant to be.<br>
A love that feels so true,<br>
A love that I'd never expect to be with someone like you. <br>

"I love you", now I admit.<br>
By the cupid's arrow, I have been hit.<br>
You're so sweet, almost like a honeycomb.<br>
Thank you for being the one who always feels like home.<br>
