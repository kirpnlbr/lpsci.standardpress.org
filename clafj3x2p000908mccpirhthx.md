# Destined Spotlight by Sencilla

⠀⠀⠀In a prominent concert hall in Moscow, hundreds of aristocrats silently watched a
man in his late 30s who once walked to the center of a wide stage. He wore a black
coat that overlaid his white polo shirt with a black long tie underneath his shirt collar.
This neat dress code created a very good first impression among the audience;
especially that it explicitly described its excellence as a known Romantic composer in
the Russian Empire of Tsars. Everything was great about him except his face. His face
was an emotionless one; it did not have any trace of anxiety or even joy unlike the usual
performers in the grand concert hall. <br?

⠀⠀⠀After he surpassed a series of careful observers, he was able to arrive at his
destined spotlight. He then positioned his precious violin underneath his chin and raised
the bow, an indication that commenced his rendition for his recently composed piece
before. The man slowly closed his eyes after the execution of the first notes. Unlike his
previous expression, his face was then full of passionate emotions at the moment. He
had completely poured his heart and soul into the piece. What makes it the most
exceptional among his other compositions was its unique way of interpreting his true
emotions towards life.<br>

⠀⠀⠀That man once mourned as a kid after finding out about his bedridden mother’s
death caused by the deadly and treacherous Cholera. He remembered how devastated
he was that night while praying outside his late mom’s bedroom for an impossible twist
of fate. It was not just a dear parent who left him alone in a cruel world but also a
precious friend in his childhood.<br>

⠀⠀⠀The subsequent fast directional changes of the bow strokes in his performance
explained how he had ups and downs in his life before. Although he might have had the
opportunity to be one of the first students of a newly established music school in his
hometown, his father was never satisfied with his improvement, thinking it was never
enough.<br>

⠀⠀⠀Few years had passed; he was honored to be a music teacher in a city where he
met his love interest. It was a boy student in his class! However, being a homosexual
person was very controversial in his country. That is the reason why he did not even
have a single chance to confess his fervent love as it might tarnish his reputation.
Unfortunately, he did not have that much freedom to express himself.<br>

⠀⠀⠀The notes dramatically got higher than another in trills as he approached the end
of the piece that made the man decide to completely give his might until he finally
finished his rendition in the most expressive way he could. It was the most powerful bow
stroke that he made throughout his performance.<br>

⠀⠀⠀It’s done. It was already done. Finally, he did it. . .<br>

⠀⠀⠀He remained his eyes closed to seize the moment. The rendition might have
already been done but his spirit was still in his music. He also gradually felt his tears
forming on his eyes because of an unexplained joy.<br>

⠀⠀⠀The man later opened his eyes by the time he heard the loud applause of the
audience. His father, who once criticized his works, caught his attention the most.
Shockingly, this was the first time he saw him gracefully smile, nod and clap for his
performance. He was happy to finally see his father proud of his son.<br>

⠀⠀⠀He also found the boy student in his class with sparkling eyes looking towards
him. Even though he never had the courage to tell him how much he cherished that boy,
he thought that seeing his twinkling smile was already enough for him.<br>

⠀⠀⠀Aside from them, he was also blissful to see everyone clapping for him, believing
it was an indication of his triumph. Though he may have suffered very much inside an
empty shell, he still ended up receiving his prize. Their praises made his hardships
worth it.<br>

⠀⠀⠀All of this made him realize that he should be grateful to God; he should thank
Him for everything. After all, he also knew that her dear mother was with Him all this
time. He was aware that They were always at his side and never left him from being a
struggling aspiring musician into a successful one, especially in his destined spotlight.<br>
