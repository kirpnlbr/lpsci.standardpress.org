# Silence by Cerritulus

*Don't speak unless spoken to<br>
Or unless I wanna get hurt<br>
I know they're just gonna judge me<br>
It's a curse I've had since birth<br>*

Most of them are self centered<br>
**They don't watch what they say**<br>
They don't care how it affects others<br>
Not in the slightest way <br>

You're not like the others<br>
You're more unalike than fire and ice<br>
If they hurt you, don't even bother<br>
Karma makes everyone pay the price<br>

So if we don't wanna get hurt<br>
We shouldn't open our mouths<br>
Nothing is fair in a world among men<br>
So find another way to let it out<br>
