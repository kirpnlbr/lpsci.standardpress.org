# Good Women by Rosa

All our life, we’ve been raised to be “A good woman.”<br>

Our bodies celebrate us on becoming women by providing us with body hair, but they expect us to shave it off.<br>

They expect us to go through nine months of pregnancy, with two lactating breasts, and push a kid out of a tiny hole.<br>

We can’t be too big, too small, too quiet, or too loud<br>
Or else, they’ll tear us down.

They tell us to be intelligent enough to avoid being naive, but not intelligent enough to make them feel unhappy.<br>

We're still trying to persuade people that no means no, fighting for our bodily autonomy, and having trouble reporting an assault<br>
Because people would rather blame our clothes than the men who ripped them off.<br>

We’re tired of being “Good women.”<br>

We’re not looking for compliments for our cross-legged pose.<br>
We’re not trying to sound like an entrancing rose.<br>

We don’t want to force a chuckle when you touch our thighs<br>
We don't want to be frightened when we walk at night.<br>

“No”, we say. So that indicates you should be on your way.<br>
Our eyes are opened, and we can see that everything’s not okay.<br>

We are more than our body,<br>
And our beauty.<br>

We also belong in conference rooms<br>
Because raising children isn’t for us to do.<br>

We are more than just “A good woman”<br>
And we also have our own choices too.<br>

We are more than just “A good woman”<br>
Can’t you see? We also have voices too.<br>
