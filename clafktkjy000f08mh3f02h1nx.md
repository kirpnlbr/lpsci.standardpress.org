# Kindness: An Act of Humanity, for Humanity by Ky

⠀⠀⠀“Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about.”
Cruel and unsympathetic as it may seem but, in our world, today, people get engulfed in their own problems and tend to forget and disregard others. This in turn creates an infinite, unending chain reaction of egomania and in this corrupt and unfair realm that we live in, those kind of people – egotistic people – are not what we need.<br>

⠀⠀⠀It is acceptable to have a bad day every now and then – everyone has it. When we have bad days, we tend to put forth the anger that we feel towards other people most frequently, to our loved ones. Unlucky days happen, it really does, but the least that we can do is to think before we act; and to be more aware of others’ feelings. Truly, we do have our own issues but being mean and careless does not get us anywhere but nowhere.<br>

⠀⠀⠀In today’s society, people are desirous. We can’t deny that, no one can. People are driven by money, goals and luxurious rewards. We have the keenest eyes on the most expensive jewels but we tend to overlook the most valuable treasure that we have and we can always share to others, the gift of kindness.<br>

⠀⠀⠀According to recent studies, kindness has psychological benefits to us humans which includes strengthened immune system, improved cognitive performance, an increase in energy, lower heart rate and will more likely make you live a longer and more satisfied life. Moreover, by just doing five random acts of kindness in a day, your happiness will increase for up to three months. Also, being kind makes your mindset more positive which in turn will make you more productive. <br>

⠀⠀⠀What the society currently needs is a change – a transformation. What we need is a society of kindness and I believe that kindness, the highest virtue, is pervasive and omnipresent. Kindness doesn’t cost anything moreover; it overturns a person’s day and makes it so much better. Just a little tap on the back or just offering a helping a hand magically turns a frown into a big smile – just like how Tinkerbell makes Peter Pan fly with just those little pixie dust of hers. Imagine if we all showed compassion to each other, wouldn’t it be so nice to live in a world like that? Wherein more sympathy exists than greed and more compassion is
extant than self-centeredness – truly, a harmonious society full of kindness. However, you may say that a society like that can only exist in my dreams but I believe it is not really impossible because kindness does not involve money or material of any sort, it’s a merciful feeling from the heart.<br>

⠀⠀⠀Actually, it isn’t just a feeling, it is like a virus that spreads quickly – it is quite contagious. When we notice others’ little acts of kindness, there’s this urge that makes us do the same. Personally, when I see people exhibiting kindness to others, I suddenly find myself wanting to do the same kind of kindness to others as well – I want to make their day, I want to be the reason why they smile amidst the downpour of difficulties in their lives and there is nothing more rewarding than the blissful feeling of making someone’s day better.<br>

⠀⠀⠀Indeed, in today’s civilization where people from different socio-economic classes live in together and injustice seem to always prevail, no one is to blame because kindness knows no barriers – may it becolor, race or status – kindness is always and will always be there.<br>

⠀⠀⠀In this cold world deluged with egocentricity and ravenousness, is a desperate need of those pixie dust of kindness.
