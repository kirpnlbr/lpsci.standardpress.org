*What are your plans during the last month of the school year?*

If you are someone that wants an adventure, then look out for AcadArena's CONQuest as it makes its return on June 2-4, 2023.

The event boasted a wide range of guests last year, and AcadArena CEO Justin Banusing aims to top last year's event with more venues, accessible meet-ups, and an even bigger catalog of guests.

From its humble beginnings in 2017 as a gaming convention in Iloilo that had only 700 attendees, it has now become one of the most renowned Philippine conventions to date, becoming the biggest yearly celebration of pop culture and gaming.

Last year, CONQuest garnered over 33,000 attendees at the SMX Convention Center in Manila. Now widely regarded as one of the largest events in the Philippines, CONQuest 2023 aims to expand its scope outside gaming and diverge into other areas such as music, food, and cosplay.

Now on its fifth edition, it aims to level up the playing field by making itself a multi-venue event with the utilization of Conrad Manila, Seashell Lane, and National University MOA on top of the already sizable SMX Convention Center.

Even if you aren’t that hardcore of a gamer and just want to enjoy the ambiance of a big convention, then CONQuest has at least something you might be interested in, as its end goal is to provide something for everyone so that you don’t feel left out.

This year, CONQuest is hosting its first-ever “Music Night,” where featured artists such as The Rose, Hyper Potions, and James Reid are going to be performing live. On top of that, it will also be the first-ever gaming convention to feature a food festival along Seashell Lane to make sure your bellies are full while exploring the convention.

CONQuest 2023 will not be complete without its featured guests. This year, Michael Reeves, LilyPichu, Valkyrae from popular content house OfflineTV, renowned AniTubers Akidearest and JoeyTheAnimeMan, and returning guests such as members of Scamily are only some of the event’s headliners.

One-day tickets from Friday to Sunday will cost you Php 800, while a three-day pass is Php 2,000. Meanwhile, fans can also purchase the Premium Pass worth Php 20,000, which grants entry to all days of CONQuest, Music Night Access, an included merch bundle, and priority lanes to MeetZones and fan meets.
